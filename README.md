## 🎮 What is NightFall?

**NightFall** is a browser-based social deduction game for **4–30 players**. Players are assigned secret roles and unique **game personas** (like "The Rose" or "The Raven"). Each night, killers attempt to strike through **QTE (Quick Time Event) mini-games** — sloppy kills leave behind physical evidence pointing to the killer's persona. Meanwhile, **every other player** investigates suspects through their own QTE. 

For a comprehensive breakdown of exactly how to play, read the **[📖 Official Gameplay Guide](./GAMEPLAY_GUIDE.md)**!

## ✨ Features (Season 2 Update)

Season 2 brings a massive overhaul to the engine, UI, and game mechanics. 

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **True Cross-Device Multiplayer** | Zero installation. Connect via WebSocket on any PC, tablet, or phone. |
| **QTE Kill System** | Kills require skill. Difficulty scales permanently with every victim. Sloppy QTEs generate physical evidence (e.g. *A torn velvet glove*). |
| **Universal Investigation** | All players investigate at night. Detectives get easy QTEs; Civilians get hard QTEs. |
| **16 Game Personas** | Randomly assigned themed identities for deep deduction gameplay. |
| **Heatmap & Suspicion Tracking** | A visual map in the UI tracking historical voting patterns to see who is framing who. |
| **Interactive Manor Tooltips** | Hover over rooms (e.g. `[Kitchen]`) in the chat to see descriptions and floor plans. |
| **Cinematic Phase Transitions** | Full-screen overlays and localized screen shake when timers hit critical. |
| **Death Recap Cards** | When you die, a dramatic overlay summarizes your survival time and location. |
| **Dynamic Audio Engine** | 100% Procedural Web Audio API SFX (drones, heartbeats, phase chimes). Zero `.mp3` files needed. |
| **Progressive Web App (PWA)** | Install NightFall directly to your phone's home screen for a native app experience. |
| **Host Migration & Recovery** | If a player drops, they have 15 seconds to rejoin. If the host leaves, another player inherits the host powers automatically. |

🏆 **Global Leaderboards & Match History:** Track your win rates, favorite personas, and most deceitful moments on a global ranking ladder.
